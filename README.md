SassSquatch is a mobile app that works as a sassy digital task manager that links your productivity to a 'sass-agotchi'. Write a to do list, mark a task as complete, and your sass-agotchi will grow and evolve! If you mark a task as incomplete, your sass-agotchi will regress, and could even eventually die. So keep completing tasks! 

This was our final group project for [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

## Technology:

Front end:
React native, a javascript-based framework was used for our app frontend. This was because React Native allowed us to easily build an app capable of working on both Andriod and IOS.

Backend:
Firebase, a cloud-based database, was used for our backend as it granted us an easy framework to set up a databse for each user.

Our animations were generated using a browser based application called 'Piskel':
